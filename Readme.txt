Plant Monitoring system using Arduino which displays temperature, light and moisture levels on an LCD display.

Circuit diagram is as shown in the image.

Plant_monitor folder contains code for the fully functional system.

Sensors folder contains programs to calibrate each sensor individually.
After uploading each program, open the serial monitor to view current analog values.
Obtain the maximum and minimum values for each sensor and replace it in the map() function.
Once the right values have been obtained, the map() function for the respective sensor in the main program can be modified.
