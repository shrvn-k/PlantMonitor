#Plant Monitor

###Plant Monitoring system using Arduino which displays temperature, light and moisture levels on an LCD display.

[Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/shrvn-k/PlantMonitor/blob/master/circuit_diagram.jpg)

[plant_monitor](https://github.com/shrvn-k/PlantMonitor/tree/master/plant_monitor) folder contains code for the fully functional system.

[sensors](https://github.com/shrvn-k/PlantMonitor/tree/master/sensors) folder contains programs to calibrate each sensor individually.

After uploading each program, open the serial monitor to view current analog values.  
Obtain the maximum and minimum values for each sensor and replace it in the map() function.  
Once the right values have been obtained, replace values in map() function in the final program.
